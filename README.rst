Around 2008, I was bored of visiting a blog to get the latest good videos published there. It felt repetitive to queue
stuff and jump to YouTube to watch it. Years later, it has expanded to all my subscriptions and it's basically become
my TV. It's something I turn on to watch the latest and newest, I enjoy it, and most of it I'll never see again.

It's not ready for other people to use yet, I don't think, but I feel I can eventually get there.

Roadmap
-------

#. Python only. No Perl, no Bashscript.
#. Use a database already, geez! These text files are embarassing!
#. A GUI of some sort. Preferably one that's easy to install on Windows.
#. Full support for all sites that youtube-dl supports. They're hundreds!
